<!--request.data: to get the raw data, when the incoming request data contains string. 
Works when data couldn't be parsed as form data. To get the raw post body regardless of the content 
type, use request.get_data(). request.data calls request.get_data(parse_form_data = True)

request.args: for URL query parameters, key/value pairs in URL query string
search = request.args.get("search")

request.form: the key/value pairs from HTML post form
email = request.form.get('email') # use get if the key might not exist
password = request.form['password'] # use indexing if you know the key exists
request.form.getlist('name'): use getlist if the key is sent multiple times and you want a list of 
values. get only returns the first value

request.values: combined args and form, preferring args if keys overlap

request.files: the files in the body, which Flask keeps separate from form. HTML forms must use 
enctype = multipart/form-data or files will not be uploaded.

request.json(): parsed JSON data. Request must have application/json content type header, or use 
request.get_json(force = True) to ignore the content type
data = request.get_json()

If you're not sure how data will be submitted, you can use an or chain to get the first one with data:
def get_request_data():
    return (request.args or request.form or request.get_json(force = True, silent = True) or request.data)
